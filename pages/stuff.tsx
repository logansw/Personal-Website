                <div>The project pages were the most complex to design, as I had to juggle a lot of considerations so they could support all kinds of content (which was yet to be written). Balancing functionality against the visuals was also challenging, requiring a ton of tweaking and redesigning. I like the system I came up with though: structurally, each page requires a logo, title, date, and color, and the page simply stretches vertically to fit more and more content, which are individual blocks of text (or other media).</div>

                <div>EasyBites is a student led start-up which connects busy food lovers with passionate home cooks. Users send any recipe and we connect them to a chef for the job. I was heavily involved in designing screens for the landing page and product, and I helped build many of the landing page pages. Specifically, I focused on implementing systems to support good responsive design! Designed in Figma, developed in React.</div>

                <div>After settling upon a name, our first design challenge was to decide upon a logo. We worked together as a team to create several candidates, and then spent a long time trying to choose among them (which always seems to be the hardest part).</div>

                  <div>Next, the EasyTeam decided to design and develop a landing page as an exercise to help us learn before jumping into the actual product and to act as a place to direct any interest that might be generated as we develop the product and market ourselves.</div>
                  <Gap height={16} />
                  <div>First, the design team made rough wireframes, only focusing on what content to include and where it would be located. Our goal was to work quickly and get feedback often:</div>

                  <div>In an attempt to ensure visual consistency and improve the speed of our work, I tried to implement a design system using Figma components, following the principle of Atomic Design. I was surprised to find out how time consuming the process of organizing components turned out to be, and in the end it probably wasn&apos;t worth the investment for most of the elements. Nevertheless, I enjoyed researching design systems and I see how it would be important for larger organizations with many more designers.</div>

                  <div>Shown below is the final design for the landing page at the time this website was written:</div>

                <ProjectSection sectionHeader="2. Code" sectionSize="h3" callout>
                  <div>To implement the designs, our team used React with TypeScript for the frontend, and Firebase for the backend. I dealt almost entirely with the frontend for this project, though it was cool to get a glimpse into how the two sides worked together from scratch.</div>
                  <Gap height={16} />
                  <div>The main challenge I stepped up to tackle was making the website responsive. Originally, we designed the pages for desktop only, intending to translate the pages over to mobile later by making small tweaks to the code. This was what the pages looked like originally: </div>

                          height={809}/>
                  <div>It was not the best. This prompted me to learn a ton of CSS and ways to implement good responsive behavior inside of React components, learnings which I took to my next project, being my personal website.</div>
                  <Gap height={16} />
                  <div>I had a lot of fun designing some of the responsive components, like the Nav Bar and Footer. Both were interesting because they required some more complicated changes between mobile and desktop, so I couldn&apos;t simply rely on flexbox but I had to investigate more sophisticated responsive design techniques.</div>

                <div>NaireAtive is another cool student led startup from UW! I had the opportunity to design their logo for them, which was a very cool experience as it was the first time I&apos;d done client work like that.</div>
              </ProjectSection>
              <ProjectSection sectionHeader="Process">
                <div>After meeting with the NaireAtive team and discussing what they kind of envisioned for a logo, I sketched a bunch of random ideas on index cards. One such design felt promising to me, which I made a rough digital version of:</div>
                <Image  src="/Page Media/NaireAtive/NaireAtive-Logo-Draft.png"
                        alt="NaireAtive logo draft"
                        width={1000}
                        height={1000} />
                <div>And then shortly thereafterI made a higher quality version: </div>
                <Image  src="/Page Media/NaireAtive/NaireAtive Vector Dark.png"
                        alt="NaireAtive logo draft vector"
                        width={452}
                        height={755} />
                <div>After a round of feedback, I updated the design slightly as follows: </div>
                <Image  src="/Page Media/NaireAtive/NaireAtive 3.png"
                        alt="NaireAtive logo v2"
                        width={462}
                        height={747} />
                <div>At this point, the team was feeling good about the design, but wanted to explore different variations to get it just right! So we discussed things we&apos;d want to look into, and I returned a few iterations: </div>
                <Image  src="/Page Media/NaireAtive/ccw30.png"
                        alt="NaireAtive logo rotated"
                        width={1500}
                        height={300} />
                <Image  src="/Page Media/NaireAtive/Extrabold Text.png"
                        alt="NaireAtive logo extrabold text"
                        width={1500}
                        height={300} />
                <Image  src="/Page Media/NaireAtive/Solid Stripe.png"

                        width={1500}
                        height={300} />
                <div>I also wanted to check to see how the different options might look at very small scales (scales at which logos are often seen): </div>
                <Image  src="/Page Media/NaireAtive/Mini Test.jpg"

                        height={225} />
                <div>Finally, after some more adjustments, we settled upon this design!</div>
